# Thank You Map!

A map to say thank you.

##Â Sorry, what?

Just a map where every label is being replaced by a way to say "thank you" in
every possible language.

Only zoom 17 is curated at this point.


## Install

This map has been built with [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik).

Once Kosmtik installed and this repository cloned, you just need to run, from
inside the repository:

    node ./path/to/kosmtik/index.js projet.yml


It uses vector tiles from [Mapzen](https://github.com/mapzen/vector-datasource)
(thanks to them!), so you need to import data locally. Of course, do not abuse.
